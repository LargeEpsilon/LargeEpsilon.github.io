This blog was born from a habit of ruining good conversations with bad mathematics. Hopefully it will provide some outlet for this impulse 
and save my personal relationships. Expect to see posts about things I'm learning, toy problems or ideas I've fiddled with, or anything 
especially beautiful that's come across my path. Mostly Number Theory.
